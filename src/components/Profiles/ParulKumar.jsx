            “Happy people are truly grateful people. They focus on the best
            things that happen to them every single day. They see a miracle in
            the smallest aspects of life.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Parul Kumar, a postgraduate from Lady Irwin College, University
            of Delhi, and holder of a Management degree, has a multi-faceted
            personality with interests in theatre and a passion for performing
            arts. She was actively involved in SPIC MACAY as the National
            Treasurer, organizing more than 200 classical concerts per year.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is also a Kathak dancer and has participated in numerous panel
            discussions on youth forums addressing social issues during her
            college years. For the past fifteen years, she has worked
            intensively as a social entrepreneur, building an inclusive and
            participatory society — a challenging yet satisfying journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parul is the Co-founder of Prabhaav Foundation, where strategy and
            project planning are her greatest passions. She is a team player,
            open to ideas and constructive criticism. The foundation focuses on
            creating an inclusive society where every individual lives with
            dignity as an empowered and self-reliant entity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prabhaav Foundation contributes to conscious living in areas of
            environment, education, health, and culture through various CSR
            projects. In 2021, she became the CEO of AK Institute of
            Ophthalmology, a state-of-the-art eye hospital headed by Padma
            Shree Dr. Atul Kumar. This role has been both challenging and
            rewarding.
